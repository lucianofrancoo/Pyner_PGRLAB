41068586,Transcriptome-based meta-analysis of drought stress regulatory genes in tomato.,2025,BMC plant biology,Journal Article; Meta-Analysis,Murtaza M; Aqeel M; Waheeb SA,10.1186/s12870-025-07348-2,PMC12513158,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/41068586,"Plants possess various molecular defense systems to ward off biotic and abiotic stresses and adjust to environmental changes. The RNA-seq technology assists biologists in quickly identifying genes responding to abiotic stresses. Thereby, using meta-transcriptomic data from the GEO NCBI public database, we have attempted to reach a consensus on gene variations. This approach identified a global set of 18 drought-responsive genes by Bonferroni-adjusted proportional test on one sample, p < 0.05, and extensive meta-transcriptome analytics. The annotation of these differentially expressed genes identified the biological process, molecular function, cellular component, KEGG, and plant ontology terms. The terms that were found to be top-enriched (with P and Q adjusted to be < 0.05) were intracellular signal transduction (Solyc04g076810 and Solyc10g076710), ribonuclease P activity (Solyc05g054420), nucleolar ribonuclease P complex (Solyc05g054420), Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and lateral root apical meristem (Solyc03g005227), respectively. These meta-DEGs description include CBL-interacting protein kinase 8 (biological process), phospholipase C2 (biological process), XH/XS domain-containing protein (molecular function & cellular component), alpha 1,4-glycosyltransferase family protein (KEGG) and Histone superfamily protein (plant ontology). qRT-PCR-based gene expression analyses elaborated the similar trends in gene expression in both local genotypes under drought stress conditions covering the ratio of six to four as per down and upregulated meta-genes, respectively. This could indicate that these genes are part of a putative set of stress-responsive genes that are crucial for survival and adaptation under drought conditions thereby, they may serve as potential targets for future functional studies and breeding applications that will be helpful to enhance tomato production in the future.",2026-02-13T12:37:58.835546
35204192,"Melatonin Improves Drought Stress Tolerance of Tomato by Modulating Plant Growth, Root Architecture, Photosynthesis, and Antioxidant Defense System.",2022,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,Altaf MA; Shahid R; Ren MX,10.3390/antiox11020309,PMC8868175,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35204192,"Tomato is an important vegetable that is highly sensitive to drought (DR) stress which impairs the development of tomato seedlings. Recently, melatonin (ME) has emerged as a nontoxic, regulatory biomolecule that regulates plant growth and enhances the DR tolerance mechanism in plants. The present study was conducted to examine the defensive role of ME in photosynthesis, root architecture, and the antioxidant enzymes' activities of tomato seedlings subjected to DR stress. Our results indicated that DR stress strongly suppressed growth and biomass production, inhibited photosynthesis, negatively affected root morphology, and reduced photosynthetic pigments in tomato seedlings. Per contra, soluble sugars, proline, and ROS (reactive oxygen species) were suggested to be improved in seedlings under DR stress. Conversely, ME (100 µM) pretreatment improved the detrimental-effect of DR by restoring chlorophyll content, root architecture, gas exchange parameters and plant growth attributes compared with DR-group only. Moreover, ME supplementation also mitigated the antioxidant enzymes [APX (ascorbate peroxidase), CAT (catalase), DHAR (dehydroascorbate reductase), GST (glutathione S-transferase), GR (glutathione reductase), MDHAR (monodehydroascorbate reductase), POD (peroxidase), and SOD (superoxide dismutase)], non-enzymatic antioxidant [AsA (ascorbate), DHA (dehydroascorbic acid), GSH (glutathione), and GSSG, (oxidized glutathione)] activities, reduced oxidative damage [EL (electrolyte leakage), H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), MDA (malondialdehyde), and O2•- (superoxide ion)] and osmoregulation (soluble sugars and proline) of tomato seedlings, by regulating gene expression for SOD, CAT, APX, GR, POD, GST, DHAR, and MDHAR. These findings determine that ME pretreatment could efficiently improve the seedlings growth, root characteristics, leaf photosynthesis and antioxidant machinery under DR stress and thereby increasing the seedlings' adaptability to DR stress.",2026-02-13T12:37:59.510136

After 16 days of exposure, plants grown under the combined deficit showed similar behavior to the one found upon exposure to single N deficit. Both N deficit treatments resulted in a significantly lower dry weight, leaf area, chlorophyll content, and N accumulation but in a higher N use efficiency when compared to control (CTR) plants. Moreover, concerning plant metabolism, at the shoot level, these two treatments also responded in a similar way, inducing higher C/N ratio, nitrate reductase (NR) and glutamine synthetase (GS) activity, expression of RuBisCO encoding genes as well as a downregulation of GS2.1 and GS2.2 transcripts. Interestingly, plant metabolic responses at the root level did not follow the same pattern, with plants under combined deficit behaving similarly to W deficit plants, resulting in enhanced nitrate and proline concentrations, NR activity, and an upregulation of GS1 and NR genes than in CTR plants. Overall, our data suggest that the N remobilization and osmoregulation strategies play a relevant role in plant acclimation to these abiotic stresses and highlight the complexity of plant responses under a combined N+W deficit.",2026-02-13T12:38:00.233408

It is deposited between the plasma membrane and the primary cell wall in specialized tissues such as root exodermis, endodermis, phellem, and seed coats. It is formed de novo in response to stresses such as wounding, salt injury, drought, and pathogen attack and is a complex polyester mainly consisting of fatty acids, glycerol, and minor amounts of ferulic acid that are associated to a lignin-like polymer predominantly composed of ferulates. Metabolomic and transcriptomic studies have revealed that cell wall lignification precedes suberin deposition. The ferulic acid esterified to ω-hydroxy fatty acids, synthetized by the feruloyl transferase FHT (or ASFT), presumably plays a role in coupling both polymers, although the precise mechanism is not understood. Here, we use the promoter of tomato suberin feruloyl transferase (FHT/ASFT) fused to GUS (β-glucuronidase) to demonstrate that ferulate deposition agrees with the site of promoter FHT activation by using a combination of histochemical staining and UV microscopy. Hence, FHT promoter activation and alkali UV microscopy can be used to identify the precise localization of early suberizing cells rich in ferulic acid and can additionally be used as an efficient marker of early suberization events during plant development and stress responses. This line can be used in the future as a tool to identify emerging suberization sites via ferulate deposition in tomato plants, which may contribute to germplasm screening in varietal improvement programs.",2026-02-13T12:38:01.018011

Plant pathogenic Ralstonia causes bacterial wilt disease and is best controlled with resistant varieties. Tomato wilt resistance is multigenic, yet the mechanisms of resistance remain largely unknown. We combined metaRNAseq analysis and functional experiments to identify core Ralstonia-responsive genes and the corresponding biological mechanisms in wilt-resistant and wilt-susceptible tomatoes. While trade-offs between growth and defence are common in plants, wilt-resistant plants activated both defence responses and growth processes. Measurements of innate immunity and growth, including reactive oxygen species production and root system growth, respectively, validated that resistant plants executed defence-related processes at the same time they increased root growth. In contrast, in wilt-susceptible plants roots senesced and root surface area declined following Ralstonia inoculation. Wilt-resistant plants repressed genes predicted to negatively regulate water stress tolerance, while susceptible plants repressed genes predicted to promote water stress tolerance. Our results suggest that wilt-resistant plants can simultaneously promote growth and defence by investing in resources that act in both processes. Infected susceptible plants activate defences, but fail to grow and so succumb to Ralstonia, likely because they cannot tolerate the water stress induced by vascular wilt.",2026-02-13T12:38:01.741625
