PRJNA1418118,RNA-Seq analyses of gasa3 mutants under 6 and 12 days of drought,2026/02/03 00:00,"We conducted RNA-Seq analyses on wild-type and gasa3 mutant plants after 6 and 12 days of drought stress. Day 6 was chosen because it marks the time point at which the first statistically significant increase in GASA3 expression is observed, whereas by day 12, expression has begun to increase exponentially (see Figure 1A). At the same time, no clear phenotypic alteration such as wilting is yet observed at that time point, even in the wild type (Figure 1b). Despite the lack of a visible phenotype, we observed a clear change in the transcriptional landscape between drought-treated and control plants as early as 6 days after water withholding, which became more pronounced at day 12 (Figure 9a and b).",2026-02-12T11:53:52.531662
PRJEB100815,Single-cell atlas of the Arabidopsis root tip,2025/10/27 00:00,"Single-cell RNA-seq profiling of >275,000 Arabidopsis thaliana root tip cells across five ecotypes (Col-0, C24, Cvi-0, Ler, and Ws-2), three mutants (aba2-3, pyl11458, and scr-3), and multiple growth conditions, including two water potential stresses (drought).",2026-02-12T11:53:53.016388
PRJNA1238261,Guard cell and whole plant expression of Arabidopsis thaliana TOR,2025/03/19 00:00,"Water use efficiency has long been considered as an important target for the breeding of improved plant performance under drought. Minimizing leaf transpirational water loss via reduction of stomatal water conductance plays a key contributory role in drought resistance. In this study, we employed both guard cell (GC) targeted and constitutive ectopic overexpression of the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase, a master regulator of multiple signaling networks in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, to investigate the impact of these expressed AtTOR transgenes in response to drought and water use efficiency. We performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis employing RNA-seq on the three Arabidopsis genotypes grown on the three water treatments, and further analysis will be used to elucidate the potential mechanism(s) contributing to differences in leaf stomatal physiology between WT and transgenic lines. Overall design: We investigate the transcriptome of 27 samples from the three treatments (well-watered, drought-treated and re-watered) of the three genotypes (WT, GC, OE), with three replicates for each condition and genotype.",2026-02-12T11:53:53.529282
PRJNA1220696,Drought Recovery in Plants Triggers a Cell-State Specific Immune Activation [RNA-seq],2025/02/07 00:00,"All organisms experience stress as an inevitable part of life, from single-celled microorganisms to complex multicellular beings. The ability to recover from stress is a fundamental trait that determines the overall resilience of an organism, yet stress recovery is understudied. To understand the stress recovery process, we studied the recovery from drought stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. We performed a fine-scale time series of bulk RNA sequencing starting 15 minutes after rehydration following moderate drought. We reveal that drought recovery is a rapid process involving the activation of thousands of recovery-specific genes. To capture these rapid recovery responses in different leaf cell types, we performed single-nucleus transcriptome analysis at the onset of post-drought recovery, identifying a cell type-specific transcriptional state developing independently across cell types. Furthermore, we reveal a recovery-induced activation of the immune system that occurs autonomously, and which enhances pathogen resistance in vivo in A. thaliana, wild tomato (Solanum pennellii) and domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. M82). Since rehydration promotes microbial proliferation and thereby increases the risk of infection, the activation of drought recovery-induced immunity may be crucial for plant survival in natural environments. These findings indicate that drought recovery coincides with a preventive defense response, unraveling the complex regulatory mechanisms that facilitate stress recovery in different plant cell types. Overall design: RNA-seq profilling of Col and camta1 mutants samples at low water, well-watered, moderate stress and stress recovey stages.",2026-02-12T11:53:54.014924
PRJNA1208465,Differential expression and localization of expansins in Arabidopsis shoots: Implications for cell wall dynamics and drought tolerance,2025/01/09 00:00,"Expansins are cell wall-modifying proteins implicated in plant growth and stress responses. In this study, we explored the differential localization of expansins in Arabidopsis thaliana shoots, with a focus on EXPA1, EXPA10, EXPA14, and EXPA15. Utilizing pEXPA::EXPA translational fusion lines, we observed distinct expression patterns of expansins, with EXPA1 primarily localized in stomatal guard cells, while EXPA10 and EXPA15 showed strong cell wall (CW) localization in epidermal and other tissues. Overexpression of EXPA1 resulted in pronounced changes in CW-related gene expression, particularly during early stages of induction, including the upregulation of other expansins and CW-modifying enzymes. The induced EXPA1 line also displayed significant morphological changes in shoots, including smaller plant size, delayed senescence, and structural alterations in vascular tissues. Additionally, EXPA1 overexpression conferred drought tolerance, as evidenced by enhanced photosynthetic efficiency (Fᵥ/FM), and low steady-state non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) values under drought stress. These findings highlight the critical role of EXPA1 in regulating plant growth, development, and stress response, with potential applications in improving drought tolerance in crops. Overall design: Comparative gene expression analysis of RNA-seq data for wild type and Dex-inducible line under three conditions (control, 3h Dex treatment, 7 days Dex treatment).",2026-02-12T11:53:54.500064
