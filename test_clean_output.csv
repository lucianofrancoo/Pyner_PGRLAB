PRJNA1418118,RNA-Seq analyses of gasa3 mutants under 6 and 12 days of drought,2026/02/03 00:00,"We conducted RNA-Seq analyses on wild-type and gasa3 mutant plants after 6 and 12 days of drought stress. Day 6 was chosen because it marks the time point at which the first statistically significant increase in GASA3 expression is observed, whereas by day 12, expression has begun to increase exponentially (see Figure 1A). At the same time, no clear phenotypic alteration such as wilting is yet observed at that time point, even in the wild type (Figure 1b). Despite the lack of a visible phenotype, we observed a clear change in the transcriptional landscape between drought-treated and control plants as early as 6 days after water withholding, which became more pronounced at day 12 (Figure 9a and b).",2026-02-12T11:53:30.845643
PRJNA1357100,ALKBH10B confers drought tolerance by sustaining the expression of photosynthesis- and drought-related genes in Arabidopsis,2025/11/05 00:00,"Epitranscriptomic N6-methyladenosine m6A RNA modification has emerged as an important regulatory layer of gene expression and protein synthesis in plant stress adaptation. In this study, expression profiling revealed that drought stress induces a global reprogramming of the m6A machinery, with ALKBH10B being the most strongly up-regulated component. Hormone-related expression analyses and promoter-driven luciferase assays suggest that ABA induces ALKBH10B transcription via ABRE and MYB cis-elements, whereas JA alleviates this activation. Moreover, ALKBH10B overexpression plants (OX-1) accumulated WT levels of ABA under drought stress but displayed markedly reduced JA content, resulting in enhanced stomatal closure, improved water-use efficiency and thus an enhanced drought tolerance. Transcriptome analysis revealed that drought stress induces fewer transcriptional changes in OX-1 plants compared to WT and the drought-sensitive alkbh10b-1 mutant. Differential expression and GO enrichment analyses highlight that photosynthesis-related processes were most affected by ALKBH10B activity, correlating with preserved chlorophyll content and PSII efficiency in OX-1. The m6A-IP-qPCR showed that ALKBH10B directly demethylates specific photosynthesis-related and drought-responsive genes, thus promoting their sustained expression during stress. Moreover, genes associated with mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis were enriched in OX-1, indicating that ALKBH10B supports energy metabolism during drought. Together, our results reveal that ALKBH10B enhances drought tolerance by coordinating m6A-dependent post-transcriptional regulation to maintain photosynthetic capacity and mitochondrial ATP homeostasis, as well as fine-tuning ABA-JA crosstalk to optimize stomatal control.",2026-02-12T11:53:31.332296
