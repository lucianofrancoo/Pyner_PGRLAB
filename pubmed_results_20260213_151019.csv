41068586,Transcriptome-based meta-analysis of drought stress regulatory genes in tomato.,2025,BMC plant biology,Journal Article; Meta-Analysis,Murtaza M; Aqeel M; Waheeb SA,10.1186/s12870-025-07348-2,PMC12513158,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/41068586,"Plants possess various molecular defense systems to ward off biotic and abiotic stresses and adjust to environmental changes. The RNA-seq technology assists biologists in quickly identifying genes responding to abiotic stresses. Thereby, using meta-transcriptomic data from the GEO NCBI public database, we have attempted to reach a consensus on gene variations. This approach identified a global set of 18 drought-responsive genes by Bonferroni-adjusted proportional test on one sample, p < 0.05, and extensive meta-transcriptome analytics. The annotation of these differentially expressed genes identified the biological process, molecular function, cellular component, KEGG, and plant ontology terms. The terms that were found to be top-enriched (with P and Q adjusted to be < 0.05) were intracellular signal transduction (Solyc04g076810 and Solyc10g076710), ribonuclease P activity (Solyc05g054420), nucleolar ribonuclease P complex (Solyc05g054420), Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and lateral root apical meristem (Solyc03g005227), respectively. These meta-DEGs description include CBL-interacting protein kinase 8 (biological process), phospholipase C2 (biological process), XH/XS domain-containing protein (molecular function & cellular component), alpha 1,4-glycosyltransferase family protein (KEGG) and Histone superfamily protein (plant ontology). qRT-PCR-based gene expression analyses elaborated the similar trends in gene expression in both local genotypes under drought stress conditions covering the ratio of six to four as per down and upregulated meta-genes, respectively. This could indicate that these genes are part of a putative set of stress-responsive genes that are crucial for survival and adaptation under drought conditions thereby, they may serve as potential targets for future functional studies and breeding applications that will be helpful to enhance tomato production in the future.",2026-02-13T15:11:31.518682

Recently, melatonin (ME) has emerged as a nontoxic, regulatory biomolecule that regulates plant growth and enhances the DR tolerance mechanism in plants. The present study was conducted to examine the defensive role of ME in photosynthesis, root architecture, and the antioxidant enzymes' activities of tomato seedlings subjected to DR stress. Our results indicated that DR stress strongly suppressed growth and biomass production, inhibited photosynthesis, negatively affected root morphology, and reduced photosynthetic pigments in tomato seedlings. Per contra, soluble sugars, proline, and ROS (reactive oxygen species) were suggested to be improved in seedlings under DR stress. Conversely, ME (100 µM) pretreatment improved the detrimental-effect of DR by restoring chlorophyll content, root architecture, gas exchange parameters and plant growth attributes compared with DR-group only. Moreover, ME supplementation also mitigated the antioxidant enzymes [APX (ascorbate peroxidase), CAT (catalase), DHAR (dehydroascorbate reductase), GST (glutathione S-transferase), GR (glutathione reductase), MDHAR (monodehydroascorbate reductase), POD (peroxidase), and SOD (superoxide dismutase)], non-enzymatic antioxidant [AsA (ascorbate), DHA (dehydroascorbic acid), GSH (glutathione), and GSSG, (oxidized glutathione)] activities, reduced oxidative damage [EL (electrolyte leakage), H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), MDA (malondialdehyde), and O2•- (superoxide ion)] and osmoregulation (soluble sugars and proline) of tomato seedlings, by regulating gene expression for SOD, CAT, APX, GR, POD, GST, DHAR, and MDHAR. These findings determine that ME pretreatment could efficiently improve the seedlings growth, root characteristics, leaf photosynthesis and antioxidant machinery under DR stress and thereby increasing the seedlings' adaptability to DR stress.",2026-02-13T15:11:32.246255
